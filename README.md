Lighting of the Lawn
====

This code is from the 2013 Lighting of the Lawn event put on by the Class Councils at UVa and the Lighting of the Lawn Planning committee. 

It's free to use, copy, clone, edit, delete, fork, and completely change in any way. You are granted all rights, and there's no need to give me any credit (but if you want to, I mean, I'll happily take it).

I simply hosted this on HostGator. Worked for our purposes. There's some cool visual effects, and it uses Bootstrap for the CSS and grid structure.

Enjoy!
